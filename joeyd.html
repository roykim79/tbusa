						When it comes to the food industry there is no shame in the game on having such an elite member of the team known as "Big Eyes" join you in on a plate or six at monthly outings in the Chicagoland area. Please, don't be fooled by his name based on his very rare Pacific Islander / Japanese descent characteristic features but rather by his look of exhilaration and excitement when it comes to these private social gathering of sorts. "Big Eyes" loves to smile and engage himself in awkward conversations which most people are shocked by. You can find him talking nonsense the second he walks in. It all starts at the hostess and goes all the way down to complete strangers around the buffet lines just to hear about their brief history of previous buffets in the past or telling them how much he hates olives. He truly is the most odd character on the team so when he is up and away from the dinner table, he tends to make other customers either smile or feel ill at ease with the food they had just placed on their plate, but to him it's all about the discomfort of fun and games to others that make him laugh inside. "Big Eyes" is a special team member who is no stranger to what any restaurant dares to put in front of him. Either it be your hottest female staff member or a freshly made medium rare piece of meat hot off the grill because whichever it is he'll know for sure which beef is more tender that evening. "Is that Fresh Horseradish Sauce? Instead, I'll have Extra Au Ju Sauce Please, Why Thank You!" "Big Eyes" is always on board when the meetings come around and is quite the fan of any restaurant on the long list of places to conquer in the near future. His specialties for a perfect outing would be fried rice with no soy sauce with extra garlic and green onions, fresh hand rolled sushi who is willing to wait and give the sushi man a heads up once it's rolled off the mat, extra wasabi and ginger, many sorts of different meat portions cooked medium rare while the table serving button stays permanently on throughout the meal, a pitcher of ice cold water always by his side, experiments with some fried foods, all Filipino breakfast, loves all the Korean side dishes at restaurants, etc. "Big Eyes" is open to eating anything or everything no matter where the meetings are held and is also known to be quite the meat lover once it's cooked just right! So, if you see this animal they call "Big Eyes" at your next outing stop by the table and say hello because who knows he might just pour you some ice cold water from his very own pitcher.
