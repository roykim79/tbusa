					<h2>Tim "Loaf" Moon</h2>

					<p>
						<div class="right"><img src="img/moon.jpg"></div>
						Strengths: Latin, multi-Asian, American, Italian and some other Euro cuisines. Connoisuer of meat loaf and all if it's many prepared variations</br>
						Weaknesses: Indo-pak cuisine, some SE Asian cuisines, some African cuisines and Durian. Basically anything that smells wrank or wrong</br>
						Top 3 Favorite places to eat: Bob Chinns', Lawry's Prime Rib, Korean BBQ Buffets
					</p>

						Pound for pound, "Loaf" represents a very serious threat on any restaurant owner's radar. Standing at a svelt 5'6, he is the ninja on the team; entering a restaurant as any other normal patron. Little does the establishment know that they will soon be calling for DEFCON level 3; increase in force readiness above that required for normal readiness. Known for a perpetually ravenous and insatiable appetite, Loaf is committed to getting his portion at all buffet lines. His kryptonite is definitely Diet Coke; as this will often be the beverage of choice and with multiple refills. Korean BBQ buffets are his favorite; able take down 10 plates of beef solo and 6 bowls of rice! Easily gets fired up for all ala carte and TBUSA outings. Loaf will often try to incite other members into a feeding frenzy. Loves to finish each victorious battle with a cooling ice creamy treat of some sort, with or without room in his stomach. Vitals: Digs all proper buffets and AYCE establishments. Self-made foodie and enjoys cooking shows. Will never pass up a free sample whilst shopping at Whole Foods. Loves the corn tortillas fresh off a hot top.
