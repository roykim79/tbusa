					"Crave Case aint no thang. They are like hors d'oeuvres before the main."</br>
					"#teambuffetusa is a safe place. It is cool to let your freak flag fly. You like beef? We will take down the whole cows! You like seafood? We collapse fisheries worldwide! You like fried shit? We do! #EpicMealTime..... squared! Don't be scurrrred.... you will never go hungry again."
				</p>
				<p>
					Hungri prefers comfort food. Proclivity for things battered and fried. Hates feeling shamed into stopping an AYCE. Appreciates the gluttony and camaraderie of #teambuffetusa. On occasion he has been know to excuse himself from the table to do air squats in the bathroom during the course of the meal. Upon his return, a casual observer may mistake the glistening of his forehead for the 'meat sweats' however that is far from the case. Hungri can often out last every member of the #teambuffetusa crew, which is the reason he often drives separately so that others can leave if they like. In addition to the battered and fried foodstuffs, Hungri will always tip his hat to quality salad bar.

					With his P90X <i>"after"</i> model physique, one might doubt he could possibly be a member of such a team. Not only is he a member, he is also one of the founders of the team. Drive down any street and he can tell you where the nearest buffet is. To maintain himself, Mr. Yuen prepares days in advance for official meetings; fasting one day, and dining on lean protiens and leafy greens such as kale and brussel sprouts the other days. It'll make sense after he send you a link to an article he read. "Miso hungry" is also the teams physical trainer, his job is the keep the team healthy and alive.

					Don't let "Bad" Roy's slender physique and dreamy eyes fool you, this specimen was trained in the jungles of Siam to master the art of buffet destruction - or as his people call it "muay thai-phoon eating".  His razor focus on food encompasses not just quantity, but also quality. His specialty lies in devouring denizens of the sea - lobsters, shrimps, crabs, oysters, clams, scallops, snails, octopi, squid, fish, crustaceans, univalves, bivalves, cephalopods, and synchronized swimmers.  But don't be fooled, land creatures!  He will readily chow down on the delicious flesh of cows, pigs, and other - just make sure it is extra rare and bloody. AKA "Evil" Roy, AKA the other Roy, AKA "Thai" Roy.

				<p>Tim "Loaf" Moon</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-3">
				<p>
					Strengths: Latin, multi-Asian, American, Italian and some other Euro cuisines. Connoisuer of meat loaf and all if it's many prepared variations</br>
					Weaknesses: Indo-pak cuisine, some SE Asian cuisines, some African cuisines and Durian.   Basically anything that smells wrank or wrong</br>
					Top 3 Favorite places to eat: Bob Chinns', Lawry's Prime Rib, Korean BBQ Buffets
				</p>
				<p>
					Pound for pound, "Loaf" represents a very serious threat on any restaurant owner's radar. Standing at a svelt 5'6, he is the ninja on the team; entering a restaurant as any other normal patron. Little does the establishment know that they will soon be calling for DEFCON level 3; increase in force readiness above that required for normal readiness. Known for a perpetually ravenous and insatiable appetite, Loaf is committed to getting his portion at all buffet lines. His kryptonite is definitely Diet Coke; as this will often be the beverage of choice and with multiple refills.
					Korean BBQ buffets are his favorite; able take down 10 plates of beef solo and 6 bowls of rice! Easily gets fired up for all ala carte and TBUSA outings. Loaf will often try to incite other members into a feeding frenzy. Loves to finish each victorious battle with a cooling ice creamy treat of some sort, with or without room in his stomach. Vitals: Digs all proper buffets and AYCE establishments. Self-made foodie and enjoys cooking shows. Will never pass up a free sample whilst shopping at Whole Foods. Loves the corn tortillas fresh off a hot top.

				<p>
					The name "Pinky" may be misleading. "Pinky" Chin is a fourth degree black belt, a fifth degree lazy mofo, a sixth degree glutton and a seventh degree cheapskate. Getting the bigest bang for the buck is definitely on the top of his priority list when attacking the buffet line. Upon being seated, he quickly takes off the jacket, rolls up the sleeves and heads straight to the food. No need for an explanation from the server, this isn't his first rodeo. When at a brazilian BBQ he will let the servers know the answer is always "Yes" ahead of time. Talking means not eating. "Pinky" knows not to waste valuable real estate in his stomach with the cheap fillers and focuses on the main course. He always manages to snag a piece of the most coveted and limited item in the buffet with every trip to the line.

					Favorites on the Buffet Line: sushi rolls, juicy meats, fresh fruits sliced with love and care </br>
					Flavor Preferences: savory, spicy, salty </br>
					Eating style: fast, slow, fast, crash

				<p>
					A journeyman who began his buffeting career in the summer of '82. The place and origin: Ponderosa Steakhouse. His family used to take him there on special occasions. The strange sights of sneeze guards, angry looks from the elderly, and unlimited portions of whatever one's dirty mouth desired.. it was Valhalla. Before the use of recreational drugs and receiving oral sex, only a good buffet experience released the chemicals associated with euphoria. In constant search of a buffet that can make a frugal man have no regrets about paying a 15% tip at a self-serve restaurant.

					Strengths: Everything and Anything</br>
					Weaknesses: Olives, Too Much Cheese
				</p>
				<p>	
					When it comes to the food industry there is no shame in the game on having such an elite member of the team known as "Big Eyes" join you in on a plate or six at monthly outings in the Chicagoland area. Please, don't be fooled by his name based on his very rare Pacific Islander / Japanese descent characteristic features but rather by his look of exhilaration and excitement when it comes to these private social gathering of sorts. "Big Eyes" loves to smile and engage himself in awkward conversations which most people are shocked by. You can find him talking nonsense the second he walks in. It all starts at the hostess and goes all the way down to complete strangers around the buffet lines just to hear about their brief history of previous buffets in the past or telling them how much he hates olives. He truly is the most odd character on the team so when he is up and away from the dinner table, he tends to make other customers either smile or feel ill at ease with the food they had just placed on their plate, but to him it's all about the discomfort of fun and games to others that make him laugh inside. "Big Eyes" is a special team member who is no stranger to what any restaurant dares to put in front of him. Either it be your hottest female staff member or a freshly made medium rare piece of meat hot off the grill because whichever it is he'll know for sure which beef is more tender that evening. "Is that Fresh Horseradish Sauce? Instead, I'll have Extra Au Ju Sauce Please, Why Thank You!" "Big Eyes" is always on board when the meetings come around and is quite the fan of any restaurant on the long list of places to conquer in the near future. His specialties for a perfect outing would be fried rice with no soy sauce with extra garlic and green onions, fresh hand rolled sushi who is willing to wait and give the sushi man a heads up once it's rolled off the mat, extra wasabi and ginger, many sorts of different meat portions cooked medium rare while the table serving button stays permanently on throughout the meal, a pitcher of ice cold water always by his side, experiments with some fried foods, all Filipino breakfast, loves all the Korean side dishes at restaurants, etc. "Big Eyes" is open to eating anything or everything no matter where the meetings are held and is also known to be quite the meat lover once it's cooked just right! So, if you see this animal they call "Big Eyes" at your next outing stop by the table and say hello because who knows he might just pour you some ice cold water from his very own pitcher.

				<p>Roy "The Emcee" Kim</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-3">
				<p>
					"I'm a simple man to please; just give me one thing, <em>more</em>."</br>
					Favorites: Beef, chicken, duck, sea bass, venison, salmon, tuna, turkey, lamb, and anything that bleeds
				</p>
				<p>	
					Clearly the best looking of the herd. When this former break dancing superstar isn't stuffing his face, he is either thinking about the next meeting or building a website for the team; salivating during the process. "The Emcee" has a very strong affinity towards the salty juicy goodness of beef; usually found at a Brazilian or Korean BBQ joint. He is not a man of many words during the meetings. With a utensil in one hand and a mouth full of food at all times, communication is difficult; usually done with the free hand in the form of pointing or a thumbs up with the occasional nod. Most meetings end with Roy in a state of a coma comparable to one after drinking an entire bottle of liquor. Usually not one to turn down an opportunity to feast with friends, the casino buffet is one he will pass on due to the many prior visits to "Sin City".
